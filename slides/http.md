# Can I even use all of this in practice?

- HTTP
- Scala loves Python (Cask)
- Scala loves Ruby on Rails (Scalatra) - microframework
- Scala loves actors (Spray/Akka HTTP)
- Scala loves Spring (Play) Future and sometimes IO
- Scala loves FP (http4s) IO
- Scala loves types (tapir) final tagless done right (it's good for libraries, and it's good when it doesn't leak)

- databases
- JSON libraries
- testing frameworks
- frontend (Scala.js)
- dependency management
- HTTP clients
- API integrations
- ...

<!--
testing: akka-testkit test problems, testing concurrent stuff is hard
-->
