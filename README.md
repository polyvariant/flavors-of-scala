# Flavors of Scala - spicing up your coding style

This repository contains the code example used in our talk.

### Abstract

The Scala language is now over 20 years old. Software engineers using it have gone on a long journey learning how they can best use it, while the language itself has evolved a lot over time.

In this talk, we'll explore the coding styles that have emerged over the last two decades. It's a really exciting topic, especially when you think about how Scala mixes object-oriented and functional programming, along with unique features like traits and implicits. 

We'll dive into how Scala was learning from other languages being "better Java," Erlang-like with Actors, and Haskell for humans with cats/scalaz. This helped the language build its own identity based on foundations of strong type safety, making impossible states unrepresentable, preferring compile over runtime errors, null safety, and more. We'll also update you with the latest coding flavors like direct style or structured concurrency programming.

At the end of the talk you'll be equipped with a bag full of flavors to spice up your coding style, bringing you more joy of programming and learning opportunities.
